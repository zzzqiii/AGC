Oral LD50 values range from 3.34 mg/kg (mouse) to 71 mg/kg (rat). Dermal LD50 values are around 50-140 mg/kg in rabbits and rats. Inhalation LC50 in rats is 2300 mg/L.\n*   **Aquatic Toxicity:** Nicotine is toxic to aquatic organisms. LC50 values for Rainbow Trout range from 0.005 mg/L to 5 mg/L. EC50 values for Water Flea range from 0.242 mg/L to 5.76 mg/L.\n*   **Chronic Toxicity:** Chronic exposure to Nicotine has shown developmental and neurotoxic effects in species such as Rainbow Trout, Zebra Danio, and African Clawed Frog.\n*   **Human Health:** In humans, inhalation exposure limits are set for air quality standards (MEG values range from 0.122 to 5.0 mg/m3).\n\nIt is important to note that this is a summary of the data, and a full review of the provided data would be needed for a comprehensive understanding of Nicotine's toxicity profile.",

The fetched data from ChEMBL reveals the following:\n\n*   **Antifungal Activity:** Carbendazim exhibits activity against a broad spectrum of fungi, including *Fusarium*, *Alternaria*, *Colletotrichum*, and *Rhizoctonia* species. It inhibits mycelial growth and spore germination in these fungi. The MIC values vary depending on the fungal species, ranging from 0.01 ug/mL to 70 ug/mL.\n*   **Activity Against Protozoa:** It shows inhibitory activity against protozoa such as *Giardia lamblia* and *Entamoeba histolytica*, with IC50 values of 57.0 nM and 204.0 nM, respectively.\n*   **Other Activities:** It is also active against certain plant pathogens and has shown some activity in plant systems.\n*   **Toxicity:** It shows toxicity in Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) leaves.",
